  Machine Learning #13'

On this episode of Learning from Machine Learning, I had the privilege of speaking with Lukas Biewald, co-founder and CEO of Weights & Biases. We traced his journey from programming games as a kid to building one of the most essential tools in AI development today. Lukas's career demonstrates that conviction often matters more than consensus—from surviving the AI winter in the mid-2000s when he was coached to remove "AI" from investor pitches, to the AlphaGo moment that changed everything and led him to take an unpaid internship at OpenAI in his thirties.

Lukas's philosophy on "automating the automation" reveals why AI developers have become the most powerful people within organizations—they're a smaller market but wield disproportionate influence. He shares his view that "if you zoom out, AI is so underhyped, you can't hype it enough." The recursive potential of machines improving machines is barely understood, yet it represents "the most powerful technology you could possibly build."

Most importantly, Lukas's philosophy that "feedback loops are your units of work" helps frame how to approach both machine learning and life. His technical leadership philosophy is uncompromising: "If you're going to work for me, you better be able to do the IC job. And I do not know how companies function without that mindset." His advice to his younger self cuts through common doubts in emerging technologies: "you think you're late, but you're early." In a world racing towards progress at all costs, this reminder couldn't be more relevant.
