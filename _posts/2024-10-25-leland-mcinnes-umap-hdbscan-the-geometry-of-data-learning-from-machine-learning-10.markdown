In this episode of Learning from Machine Learning, we explore the intersection of pure mathematics and modern data science with Leland McInnes, the mind behind an ecosystem of tools for unsupervised learning including UMAP, HDBSCAN, PyNN Descent and DataMapPlot. As a researcher at the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing, Leland has fundamentally shaped how we approach and understand complex data.

Leland views data through a unique geometric lens, drawing from his background in algebraic topology to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within complex datasets. This perspective led to the creation of UMAP, a breakthrough in dimensionality reduction that preserves both local and global data structure to allow for incredible visualizations and clustering. Similarly, his clustering algorithm HDBSCAN tackles the messy reality of real-world data, handling varying densities and noise with remarkable effectiveness.
