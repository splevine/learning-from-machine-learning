Learning from Machine Learning explores more than just algorithms and data: Life lessons from the experts. This episode we welcome Vincent Warmerdam, creator of calmcode, and machine learning engineer at spaCy to discuss Data Science, models and much more.

Vincent brings a unique perspective to machine learning - emphasizing practical, calm approaches to data science rather than getting caught up in the latest hype. His work at calmcode.io demonstrates that sometimes the best way to learn complex topics is through clear, simple explanations.
