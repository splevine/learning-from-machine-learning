This episode features Dr. Michelle Gill, Tech Lead and Applied Research Manager at NVIDIA, working on transformative projects like BioNemo to accelerate drug discovery through AI. Her team explores Biofoundation models to enable researchers to better perform tasks like protein folding and small molecule binding.

Michelle shares her incredible journey from wet lab biochemist to driving cutting edge AI at NVIDIA. Michelle discusses the overlap and differences between NLP and AI in biology. She outlines the critical need for better machine learning representations that capture the intricate dynamics of biology.

Michelle provides advice for beginners and early career professionals in the field of machine learning, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest tools and techniques. She also shares insights on building successful multidisciplinary teams.

After hearing her fascinating PyData NYC keynote, it was such an honor to have her on the show to discuss innovations at the intersection of biochemistry and AI.
