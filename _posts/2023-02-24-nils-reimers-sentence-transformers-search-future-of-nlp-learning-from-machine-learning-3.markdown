This episode welcomes Nils Reimers, Director of Machine Learning at Cohere and former researcher at Hugging Face, to discuss Natural Language Processing, Sentence Transformers and the future of Machine Learning.

Nils is best known as the creator of Sentence Transformers, a powerful framework for generating high-quality sentence embeddings that has become increasingly popular in the ML community with over 9K stars on Github. With Sentence Transformers, Nils has enabled researchers and developers (including me) to train state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, semantic similarity, and question-answering.

His contributions have been recognized by numerous awards and publications in top-tier conferences and journals.
