This episode features Lewis Tunstall, machine learning engineer at Hugging Face and author of the best selling book Natural Language Processing with Transformers. He currently focuses on one of the hottest topic in NLP right now reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Lewis holds a PhD in quantum physics and his research has taken him around the world and into some of the most impactful projects including the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. Lewis shares his unique story from Quantum Physicist to Data Scientist to Machine Learning Engineer.
